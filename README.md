Unofficial drinking optimizer for "The Flying Saucer" (beer pub chain) 

Eight years ago I left the corporate world and decided to play with writing Android code in my retirement.  
This was my first Android app.  There's a lot that I have learned, so a lot of this code is somewhat 
cringeworthy, it doesn't crash too very much.  Today I'm putting it up here so that if I happen not to
be around to maintain it, or even to hand it off, someone else can pick it up.

I replicated the function of this original Android version of Knurder in a iPhone version.
That version is written in Swift.  That is open source as well.  But I don't have an 
iOS computer any more, so I can't update it, and it doesn't work any more, since the Saucer's 
web site changed.  I'm looking for someone to pick that up.
