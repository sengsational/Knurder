# Knurder
Unofficial drinking optimizer for "The Flying Saucer" (beer pub chain) 

Eight years ago I left the corporate world and decided to play with writing Android code in my retirement.  
This was my first Android app.  There's a lot that I have learned, so a lot of this code is somewhat 
cringeworthy, it doesn't crash too very much.  Today I'm putting it up here so that if I happen not to
be around to maintain it, or even to hand it off, someone else can pick it up.

I've replicated some of the function of this original Android version of Knurder in a iPhone version.
That version is written in Swift.  I plan to make that open source as well.
