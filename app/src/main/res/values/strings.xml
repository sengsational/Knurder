        <![CDATA[<p>You are running version %1$s.</p><p>I hope you like it (and rate highly it in the Play Store, if you would).
        I\'m interested in hearing if you were <b>surprised</b> by anything while using the app.
        That could mean you were thinking "I wish I could&#8230;", or sometimes means you thought it should work differently or maybe work at all!</p></p>
        When you report, please include the phone hardware type (ie Samsung xyz) you\'re running on, as much detail as you can (what you were doing at the time),
        the version number above, and if not obvious, what about it that was \'unexpected\'.  Thanks!  knurder.frog4food@recursor.net or www.facebook.com/ufoknurder<p>]]>

        <p>Since this app is unofficial, I don\'t know what the URL\'s are for all stores.  If you\'d like to help out other patrons of The %1$s, you could
        share the URL via email with me, then I could build it into the app so the QR code scan would become unnecessary.
